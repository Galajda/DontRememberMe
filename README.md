# DontRememberMe
Bibliocommons https://www.bibliocommons.com/ provides library catalog products to public libraries in North America. Their login page has a checkbox to remember login data. While this common feature is convenient for home use, it can compromise the privacy of patrons accessing the catalog on public computers, such as those in the library itself. This extension disables the checkbox. The content script section of the manifest has been designed to accommodate all clients. The versatility has been verfied on five clients--Arapahoe, Austin, Chicago, Hennepin and Seattle.

This project is an independent effort by a library patron. Neither Bibliocommons nor the public libraries mentioned above endorse this work. They have provided no technical knowledge or financial support.
